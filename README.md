Serverless URL shortener based on Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Workers KV.

## Setup

### 1. Deploy Worker to Cloudflare

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/L480/url-shortener)

### 2. Create KV Namespace and KV Binding

### 3. Grab Your Worker URL

Grab your Worker URL and go to `https://url-shortener.my-account.workers.dev/shorten`.

> [!TIP]
> Use [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) to protect the `/shorten` route behind an [Entra ID authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/cloudflare-integration).

## FAQ

- How long are the shortened URLs?
    - By default it's your root domain `example.com` + a 3 character alias (`example.com/aS3`). Shortening the same URL multiple times would result in the same alias. 3 characters would last for about 200k unique aliases if no hash collision occurs. After exceeding ~200k unique aliases, each new alias is a hash collision, resulting in the behavior described below.
- What happens in case of a hash collision?
    - In case of a hash collision an additional character would be appended to your alias (`example.com/aS3q`).
    - Hash collisions increase the read operations on the KV namespace (+1 for each appended character), resulting in higher costs. If you are expecting many alias creations, increase [`ALIAS_LENGTH`](wrangler.toml#L14) before going live.
- Can I increase the length of my aliases?
    - You can increase the alias length via the [`ALIAS_LENGTH`](wrangler.toml#L14) variable.
    - Only increase [`ALIAS_LENGTH`](wrangler.toml#L14) if your KV namespace is empty, otherwise duplicated aliases are being created.
- Are the aliases the same across all deployed workers?
    - If you don't change the [`SALT`](wrangler.toml#L15) variable, the aliases will be the same.
